# Works

This repository contains some of my works and/or scripts which I used in the past.

--> data_engineering: data connectors for various sources. AWS and BigQuery scripts are currently being refactored (coming soon !).

--> data_science: contains mostly Jupyter Notebooks created for Kaggle Machine Learning challenges as well as Machine Learning tutorials.

--> google_apps_script: contains Google Apps Script codes used for projects on Google Sheets.
